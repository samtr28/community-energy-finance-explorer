A nonprofit, cooperative, charity, or Indigenous-led organization (the bond issuer) borrows money from community members (the lenders, also referred to as bondholders). It promises to repay them with interest over a specified period. \n<br><br>\nThey are <b>exempt, private-market securities </b>(not traded on exchanges), usually structured like promissory notes with fixed principal, term, and interest, while also delivering social, cultural, and environmental value."

        More than a financial tool, community bonds let everyday people invest directly in local projects — from solar farms to arts centers to affordable housing. The result is a <b>win-win:</b> organizations access affordable capital for mission-driven work, while investors earn a return and contribute to strengthening their community.

        Community bonds are best suited for projects that have clear social or environmental value and generate steady revenue to repay investors over time. They are best <b>suited to asset-backed projects </b> (infrastructure, equipment, real estate) that generate reliable income to service debt and repay investors. Examples include:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Renewable energy</b> – solar cooperatives, community wind farms, district energy projects</li>
        <li><b>Affordable housing</b> – land trust housing development or co-op housing retrofits </li>
        <li><b>Community infrastructure</b> – innovation hubs, health clinics, art spaces</li>
        <li><b>Local food systems</b> – urban farms, food co-ops </li>
        <li><b>Education & culture</b> – learning centers, performance venues, museums</li>
        </ul>
        If the project brings the community together, delivers social and/or environmental value, and pays for itself over time, it’s likely a good fit.

        The beauty of community bonds is that they tap into a robust funding base beyond traditional financial institutions. This includes:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Local citizens who want to invest in positive changes in their own communities</li>
          <li>Community foundations, family foundations, and other impact investors</li>
          <li>Values-aligned institutions (churches, unions, social enterprises)</li>
        </ul>
        Investment amounts range from $1,000 to $100,000, with typical returns of 2-6% interest over a 3–7-year period. Unlike stocks, community bonds are not traded on an exchange; they are acquired directly from the issuing organization through a tailored offering.

        Organizations must be:
        <br><br>

        <ul>
          <li>Nonprofits, registered charities, cooperatives, or Indigenous-led entities</li>
          <li>Able to manage investor relationships, legal disclosures, and reporting</li>
          <li>Committed to transparency, accountability, and mission alignment</li>
        </ul>

        They don't need to be large organizations - but they do need to be trustworthy, well-organized and transparent about how the proceeds from the bond issue are used.
